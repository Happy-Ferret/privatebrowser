A privacy-focused browser for Firefox OS.

No history, no bookmarks, no session restore.
Good for porn.

Tabs still have internal history and cookies to
make browsing comfortable enough. But all is destroyed
when the browser is closed.

Also, if the browser is in the background for more
than 3 minutes, all tabs and private data are
destroyed.
