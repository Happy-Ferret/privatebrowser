No history, no bookmarks, no session restore.
Good for porn.

Tabs still have internal history and cookies to
make browsing comfortable enough. But all is destroyed
when the browser is closed or if the browser is in the
background for more than 3 minutes (then everything gets
cleared, history, session, cookies, and tabs are destroyed).
